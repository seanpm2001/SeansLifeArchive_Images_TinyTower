# Notice - Didn't play

## 2021, August 13th status post

On 2021, January 27th, my phone was auto-updated to Android 11. Tiny Tower kept crashing upon trying to play, and I lost my 620+ consecutive day streak. Accidentally a few days later, I found the game worked again, but didn't feel like playing due to my lost progress. I am still trying to gain interest to play again.

As of 2021, August 13th, I have not resumed gameplay. On 2021, February 17th, this status post was shortened to save memory. See previous entries for more info.

## Will you start playing again?

I have been starting to consider playing at night again, but at the moment, I am happy to have no major tasks to do after I wrap up GitHub work for the night.

## Counter

I have not played Tiny Tower in `199` days (as of 2021, August 13th at 11:59:59:99 pm, as I haven't played since 2021, January 27th)
