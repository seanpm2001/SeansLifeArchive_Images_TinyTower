# Notice - Didn't play

## 2021, August 25th status post

On 2021, January 27th, my phone was auto-updated to Android 11. Tiny Tower kept crashing upon trying to play, and I lost my 620+ consecutive day streak. Accidentally a few days later, I found the game worked again, but didn't feel like playing due to my lost progress. I am still trying to gain interest to play again.

As of 2021, August 20th, I have not resumed gameplay. On 2021, February 17th, this status post was shortened to save memory. See previous entries for more info.

On 2021, August 13th, this post was modified to comply with ISO 8601.

On 2021, August 16th, new info (late) regarding the 2 daily games that have been recently added was mentioned.

## Will you start playing again?

I have been starting to consider playing at night again, but at the moment, I am happy to have no major tasks to do after I wrap up GitHub work for the night.

As of the past 2 months (2021 July 1st - 2021 August 25th), I have had 2 other games (Smurfs Village and Motor World Car Factory) replace my daily video game slots, it is going to be difficult to get back into Tiny Tower.

## Counter

I have not played Tiny Tower in `211` days (as of 2021, August 25th at 11:59:59:99 pm, as I haven't played since 2021, January 27th)
