# Notice - Didn't play

## July 17th 2021 status post

On January 27th 2021, my phone was auto-updated to Android 11. Tiny Tower kept crashing upon trying to play, and I lost my 620+ consecutive day streak. Accidentally a few days later, I found the game worked again, but didn't feel like playing due to my lost progress. I am still trying to gain interest to play again.

As of July 17th 2021, I have not resumed gameplay. On February 17th 2021, this status post was shortened to save memory. See previous entries for more info.

## Will you start playing again?

I have been starting to consider playing at night again, but at the moment, I am happy to have no major tasks to do after I wrap up GitHub work for the night.

## Counter

I have not played Tiny Tower in `172` days (as of July 17th 2021 at 11:59:59:99 pm, as I haven't played since January 27th 2021)
