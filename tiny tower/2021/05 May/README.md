# My May 2021 Tiny Tower experience

This directory contains my Tiny Tower pictures from all of May 2021 (total: 0, as of May 1st 2021)

May 2021 would have been my 25th consecutive month playing Tiny Tower if the game didn't mess up in January 2021.

On January 26th 2021, my consecutive day streak broke when I couldn't play Tiny Tower that night. My phone recently updated, and now the app crashed upon start and would not load. I attempted a few day later, but I didn't feel like playing anymore. I didn't play for the rest of the month (and still have not resumed gameplay as of May 1st 2021)

## Some notes

1. I did not get any screenshots this month, as I didn't feel like playing at all this month (as of May 1st 2021)

2. With my new phone, screenshots are in 2400x1080 resolution, instead of 2560x1440 on my last phone.

3. I used to play the Android version of Tiny Tower

4. Images were in JPG format

5. I used to play on a daily basis (as of January 25th 2021 and below)

6. No other notes for this month
