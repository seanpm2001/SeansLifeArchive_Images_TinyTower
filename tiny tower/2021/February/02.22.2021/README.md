# Notice - Didn't play

On January 27th 2021, my phone was auto-updated to Android 11. Tiny Tower kept crashing upon trying to play, and I lost my 620+ consecutive day streak. Accidentally a few days later, I found the game worked again, but didn't feel like playing due to my lost progress. I am still trying to gain interest to play again.

As of February 22nd 2021, I have not resumed gameplay. On February 17th 2021, this status post was shortened to save memory. See previous entries for more info.
