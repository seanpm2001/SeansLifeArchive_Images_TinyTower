# Notice - Didn't play

## 2021, September 16th status post

On 2021, January 27th, my phone was auto-updated to Android 11. Tiny Tower kept crashing upon trying to play, and I lost my 620+ consecutive day streak. Accidentally a few days later, I found the game worked again, but didn't feel like playing due to my lost progress. I am still trying to gain interest to play again.

## Will you start playing again?

I have been starting to consider playing at night again, but at the moment, I am happy to have no major tasks to do after I wrap up GitHub work for the night.

As of the past 2 months (2021 July 1st - 2021 August 31st), I have had 2 other games (Smurfs Village and Motor World Car Factory) replace my daily video game slots, it is going to be difficult to get back into Tiny Tower.

As of 2021 August 28th, I have taken a hiatus from these games, as I developed a mild fever and am still recovering. (2021 August 27th to 2021 August 30th)

The hiatus is planned to end on 2021 September 1st.

The hiatus ended on 2021 September 1st and I am really starting to consider playing again on 2022 January 1st even if it means restarting my streak. The date may be moved earlier depending on how much momentum I put into the idea.
