!-->

- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay today after a 1,111 day hiatus. It was a little stressful for the 2 days before I returned, as I didn't know how to re-acclimate. Returning was actually very easy. I had an extremely good time playing today. I received lots of rewards, and began construction on my 169th floor (a residential level) did some friend visits, restocking, and unlocked a 6th golden ticket. The session went on longer than expected. I will return again next week, but as of 2024, February 12th, a separate 2024 Tiny Tower Git-image repository is not available. - 2024, Monday, February 12th

### Updates

- I have not updated the game in a really long time. I played an older version of the game for the first segment of my session, but decided to do the update that I was worried about. It wasn't as game breaking as I expected, but it doesn't entirely feel like the same game anymore. - 2024, Monday, February 12th

### Friend visits

- I visited some of my friends prior to doing the update, but didn't view the others after updating, even though I was now capable. - 2024, Monday, February 12th

### Golden tickets

- I earned a 6th golden ticket today via a quest reward. The new version of the game makes it so you can boost floors with a golden ticket multiple times. I am going to continue using only 1 boost per level, until there are no levels left to boost this way, then I will start double and triple boosting. - 2024, Monday, February 12th
