- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay today after a 1,111 day hiatus. It was a little stressful for the 2 days before I returned, as I didn't know how to re-acclimate. Returning was actually very easy. I had an extremely good time playing today. I received lots of rewards, and began construction on my 169th floor (a residential level) did some friend visits, restocking, and unlocked a 6th golden ticket. The session went on longer than expected. I will return again next week, but as of 2024, February 12th, a separate 2024 Tiny Tower Git-image repository is not available. - 2024, Monday, February 12th

- I came back to Tiny Tower for a second consecutive week, and had an excessively long session. I have become more critical of the game, but I don't entirely hate the new updates, as long as you can play older versions in a virtual machine. The game has always been freemium, but there are just so many things that require watching an ad now. Also, the interface surrounding all of it, and everything that goes on at once is a bit overwhelming. Still, this is like the Capital City of Nimblebit games, so it deserves work to be done on it. I received lots of rewards today, completed many quests, began construction on my 170th floor (a residential level) and my 171st level (also a residential level) coins are so easy to get, that they almost seem valueless now. It used to take me months to rack up 20 million coins, now I can get that many in a single day (in less than 4 hours) I got to play with the house for the first time today, the Mykea joke is nice, and I like the house idea. Bux are also so easy to get now that the house isn't going to be as much work as it would have been if the game was still like it was 3 years ago. I also finished construction on 1 monument today. I played for a very long time, and eventually wrapped up and quit. The session went on for a lot longer than expected. I will return again next week, but as of 2024, February 19th, a separate 2024 Tiny Tower Git-image repository is not available. - 2024, Monday, February 19th

### Updates

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

- I have not updated the game in a really long time. I played an older version of the game for the first segment of my session, but decided to do the update that I was worried about. It wasn't as game breaking as I expected, but it doesn't entirely feel like the same game anymore. - 2024, Monday, February 12th

</details>

- No new updates were needed. - 2024, Monday, February 19th

### Friend visits

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

- I visited some of my friends prior to doing the update, but didn't view the others after updating, even though I was now capable. - 2024, Monday, February 12th

</details>

- I didn't visit any of my friends today. I didn't feel like it. The coin reward for any friend visit just didn't feel worth it today, and I had a general disinterest. I still visited the friends list. - 2024, Monday, February 19th

### Golden tickets

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

- I earned a 6th golden ticket today via a quest reward. The new version of the game makes it so you can boost floors with a golden ticket multiple times. I am going to continue using only 1 boost per level, until there are no levels left to boost this way, then I will start double and triple boosting. - 2024, Monday, February 12th

</details>

- I did not earn any golden tickets today.

### House

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

- No older entries

</details>

- I unlocked the house today for 25000 bux, and did very brief customizations to it. The cost of unlocking the region was 25000 bux. The Mykea joke was good, and with the way bux are earned now, it shouldn't be too hard to customize the house. - 2024, Monday, February 19th
