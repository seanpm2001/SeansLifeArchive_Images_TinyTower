# Notice - Didn't play

## 2022, June 14th status post

On 2021, January 27th, my phone was auto-updated to Android 11. Tiny Tower kept crashing upon trying to play, and I lost my 620+ consecutive day streak. Accidentally a few days later, I found the game worked again, but didn't feel like playing due to my lost progress. I am still trying to gain interest to play again.

I am starting to get close to 620+ consecutive days of **NOT** playing Tiny Tower. If I continue at this rate, I will be there in 117 days (on 2022 October 9th)

## Will you start playing again?

<details><summary><H3>Old updates [click/tap here to expand/collapse]</H3></summary>

Likely no. I will stop posting these updates on 2022 Janaury 1st if I don't resume by then. This is getting really tedious to keep doing. - 2021 Saturday, December 11th

Update: I am considering extending the date, I don't want to close the door too soon. - 2021 Monday Decemnber 13th

</details>

Update: I am considering resuming gameplay in late 2022 or early 2023. New data will be split out to a new repository. I am still trying to work it into my schedule. - 2022, Thursday, June 9th

As of the past 2 months (2021 July 1st - 2021 August 31st), I have had 2 other games (Smurfs Village and Motor World Car Factory) replace my daily video game slots, it is going to be difficult to get back into Tiny Tower.

As of 2021 August 28th, I have taken a hiatus from these games, as I developed a mild fever and am still recovering. (2021 August 27th to 2021 August 30th)

The hiatus is planned to end on 2021 September 1st.

The hiatus ended on 2021 September 1st and I am really starting to consider playing again on 2022 January 1st even if it means restarting my streak. The date may be moved earlier depending on how much momentum I put into the idea.
