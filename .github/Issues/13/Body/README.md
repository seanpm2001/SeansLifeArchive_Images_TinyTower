### [Upload error] Content for March 20th 2020 should be swapped for March 22nd 2020

I made an uploading error when uploading content for March 22nd 2020. I uploaded the March 20th 2020 content to the March 22nd 2020 directory, and March 22nd data to the March 20th 2020 directory. This was a bad error, but if anyone is willing to make a future functional pull request to fix it, I will accept it. I don't know how I made this error, I really should have noticed.
