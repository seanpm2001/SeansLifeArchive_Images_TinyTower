### [September 2019] 1 archives is now known to be missing

Yesterday (October 22nd 2020) I started to upload my old Tiny Tower data to GitHub. I prepared and sorted a lot on the 22nd and the 23rd. So far, I have successfully fully sorted 2019. Out of this, I have noted that 1 daily archive in September 2019 is missing, from the day September 6th 2019.

They are likely still on an external hard drive, and I will begin to look for them at some point.
