### [March 2020] Day 30 and 31 missing

This morning, I began preparing the next 3 months of pictures, ranging from January 1st 2020 to March 31st 2020 (the last of the files stored on my local hard drive) and I found that March 2020 is missing data for March 30th 2020 and March 31st 2020. This is around the time I stopped sorting the Tiny Tower pictures into the official Tiny Tower folder, so I am pretty sure they are just on an external hard drive. Once I catch up to this point, I will only need to catch up on another 3 months of pictures. This is also my first GitHub issue raised in November 2020.

Not a very big deal, I just wanted to make note of this to myself.
