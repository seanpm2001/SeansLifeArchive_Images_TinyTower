### [May 2019] 3 archives are now known to be missing

Yesterday (October 22nd 2020) I started to upload my old Tiny Tower data to GitHub. I prepared and sorted a lot on the 22nd and the 23rd. So far, I have successfully fully sorted 2019. Out of this, I have noted that 3 daily archives in May 2019 are known to be missing, they are on the days:

1. May 25th 2019
2. May 28th 2019
3. May 30th 2019

They are likely still on an external hard drive, and I will begin to look for them at some point.
