I made an error. These folders were already available to me, and I will be uploading them later. I sorted the uploads for this project into 4 categories: `/` (no separate directory) less than 100, `/1/` - 101-200 files `/2/` - 201-300 files and `/3/` - 301-400 files. When I raised this issue, I was in `1/` and didn't know that the missing files were in other folders. This issue is now closed, this is my explanation.
