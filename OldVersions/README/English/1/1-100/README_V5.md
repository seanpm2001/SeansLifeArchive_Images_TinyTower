# SeansLifeArchive_Images_TinyTower
The module for my life story project that contains my Tiny Tower images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all my daily Tiny Tower session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimblebit.tinytower&hl=en&gl=US) but when I originally played in 2012/2013, I played the [iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-tower/id422667065)

These daily pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images. You can learn more about Tiny Tower by [clicking/tapping here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Tower).

I started playing Tiny Tower again on May 9th 2019. Currently, images on my local hard drive span from May 9th 2020 to the present day, but images in several months along with data from March 29th 2020 to July 2020 is missing.

I played the game in the past on iOS from 2012 to 2013. I made it to 41 floors, but then a bug happened and the game got so stuck I had to reset my tower.

I attempted to play on Android again in sometime in 2015 (I can't pinpoint it exactly) but it was requiring me to create a mobage account, and I was unable to do that, so I didn't play until another few years. I stopped playing, but started playing again on May 9th 2019. I have been playing daily ever since.
