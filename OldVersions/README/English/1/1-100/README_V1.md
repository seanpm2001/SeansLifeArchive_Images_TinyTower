# SeansLifeArchive_Images_TinyTower
The module for my life story project that contains my Tiny Tower images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all mt daily Tiny Tower session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimblebit.tinytower&hl=en&gl=US) but when I originally played in 2012/2013, I played the [iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-tower/id422667065)

These daily pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images. You can learn more about Tiny Tower by [clicking/tapping here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Tower).
